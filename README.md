#  IoT Plant Monitoring and Alert System


The IoT Plant Monitoring and Alert System is designed to monitor the environmental conditions of a plant and send alert messages via the WhatsApp API when critical conditions are detected. This project leverages an ESP8266-based web server to collect and display real-time sensor data, allowing plant owners to remotely track the well-being of their plants.

## Hardware

In this project is used the following Hardware:
- ESP8266 NodeMCU
- DHT11 Sensor (Temperature & Humidity Sensor)
- Soil Moisture Sensor
- 5V Water Pump
- Power Supply
